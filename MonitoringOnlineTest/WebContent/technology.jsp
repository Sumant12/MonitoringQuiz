<p style="font-size:18px ">
Java is a set of several computer software and specifications developed by Sun Microsystems, 
later acquired by Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it 
in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices 
and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. While less common, Java applets run in secure, 
sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications and can be embedded in HTML pages.

<h2 align="center"><span class="label label-primary">JSP</span></h2>
<p style="font-size:18px ">
JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, 
or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP, 
but it uses the Java programming language.
To deploy and run JavaServer Pages, a compatible web server with a servlet container, 
such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, is required.

<h2 align="center"><span class="label label-primary">MySQL</span></h2>
<p style="font-size:18px ">
MySQL is (as of July 2013) the world's second most widely used relational database management system (RDBMS) and most 
widely used open-source RDBMS. It is named after co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, My. 
The SQL acronym stands for Structured Query Language.

The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, 
as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, 
the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation.
