      E-testing systems are widely adopted in academic environments, as well as in combination with other assessment means, 
      providing tutors with powerful tools to submit different types of tests in order to assess learner's knowledge. 
      Among these, multiple- choice tests are extremely popular, since they can be automatically corrected. 
      However, many learners do not welcome this type of test, because often, it does not let them properly express their capacity, 
      due to the characteristics of multiple-choice questions of being closed-ended. Even many examiners doubt about the real
       effectiveness of structured tests in assessing learner's knowledge, and they wonder whether learners are more conditioned
        by the question type than by its actual difficulty.

      In this project, we propose a data exploration approach exploiting information visualization in order to involve tutors in a 
      visual data mining process aiming to detect structures, patterns, and relations between data, which can potentially reveal 
      previously unknown knowledge inherent in tests, such as the test strategies used by the learners, correlations among different
       questions, and many other aspects, including their impact on the final score .It captures the occurrence of question browsing 
       and answering events by the learners and uses these data to visualize charts containing a chronological review of tests. 
       Other than identifying the most frequently employed strategies, the tutor can determine their effectiveness by correlating 
       their use with the final test scores.
